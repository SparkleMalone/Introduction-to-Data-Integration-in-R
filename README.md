# Introduction-to-Data-Integration-in-R

Data analysis often requires combining data from multiple sources, such as files, databases, APIs, or web scraping. R is a powerful and flexible tool for data integration, but it can also pose some challenges and pitfalls. In this workshop, you will learn some of the best ways to integrate data from multiple sources in R.

#### Workshop Goals: 

1. Understand techniques for data Integration. 
2. Combine information from tabular data sources.
3. Combine tabular and vector data.
4. Combine tabular and raster data. 

#### Choose the right package
R has many packages that can help you import, merge, and manipulate data from different sources. Some of the most popular and useful ones for tables include readr, dplyr, tidyr, and purrr. These packages are part of the tidyverse, a collection of packages that share a consistent and coherent syntax and philosophy for data analysis. For spatial data, the sf and terra packages are useful.

| Type of Data| Library| 
|Tabular| tidyverse|
| Vector| sf|
| Raster | terra|

#### Use pipes and functions
One of the best features of the tidyverse is the pipe operator (%>%), which allows you to chain multiple functions together and pass the output of one function as the input of the next one. This way, you can create a data integration pipeline that is clear and logical, and that avoids intermediate variables and nested functions.

#### Check and validate data

Data integration can introduce errors or inconsistencies in your data, such as duplicates, mismatches, outliers, or invalid values. Therefore, it is important to check and validate your data before and after you integrate it from multiple sources. You can use various tools and techniques to do this, such as summary statistics, data visualization, data profiling, or data quality rules.

In this workshop you will begin to extract information about the FLUXNET CH4 tower sites.

# Integrating information from simple features

Import data
```{r, include=T}
FluxNet <- read.csv('Data/FluxNet_Sites_2024.csv')
```
Column Name | Description |
|------:|-----------|
|SITE_ID| Unique site id|
|LOCATION_LAT|Location information|
|LOCATION_LONG|Location information|

Convert FLUXNETCH4 to a sf
```{r, include=T}
FLUXNET.CH4.shp <- st_as_sf(x = FluxNet,                         
           coords = c("LOCATION_LONG",  "LOCATION_LAT"),
           crs = 4326)

ggplot(data=FLUXNET.CH4.shp ) + geom_sf()

```
check the class and that the geometry is valid:
```{r, include=T}
class(FLUXNET.CH4.shp)
st_is_valid(FLUXNET.CH4.shp)
```

Create a global sf and extract the country into the sf

```{r, include=T}
global <- aoi_get(country= c("Europe","Asia" ,"North America", "South America", "Australia","Africa", "New Zealand"))

st_is_valid(global)

# Make the CRS match

FLUXNET.CH4.shp = st_transform(FLUXNET.CH4.shp, crs= '+init=epsg:4087')
global = st_transform(global, crs= '+init=epsg:4087')

ggplot() + geom_sf(data = global) + geom_sf(data = FLUXNET.CH4.shp) 

# Use the st_intersect to extract the courntry of each tower site:

FLUXNET.CH4.shp$Country <- st_intersection( global, FLUXNET.CH4.shp)$name
```
 
# Integrating information from rasters
Import soil information
```{r, include=T}
soil <- terra::rast("Data/GlobalSoil_grids.tif" )
crs(soil)
```
Transform to the same CRS:
```{r, include=T}
FLUXNET.CH4.shp = st_transform(FLUXNET.CH4.shp, crs= crs(soil))
```
Extract soil information to sf:
```{r, include=T}
FLUXNET.CH4.shp$SOIL_BulkDensity = terra::extract(soil, FLUXNET.CH4.shp)$BulkDensity

FLUXNET.CH4.shp$SOIL_PH = terra::extract(soil, FLUXNET.CH4.shp)$PH

FLUXNET.CH4.shp$SOIL_Nitrogen = terra::extract(soil, FLUXNET.CH4.shp)$Nitrogen
```

Import climate information
```{r, include=T}
climate <- terra::rast("Data/GlobalClimate.tif" )
crs(climate)
```
Transform to the same CRS:
```{r, include=T}
FLUXNET.CH4.shp = st_transform(FLUXNET.CH4.shp, crs= crs(climate))
```
Look at the data that is available:
```{r, include=T}
names(climate)
```
Extract climate information to sf:
```{r, include=T}
FLUXNET.CH4.shp$MAP = terra::extract(climate, FLUXNET.CH4.shp)$MAP
FLUXNET.CH4.shp$TMIN = terra::extract(climate, FLUXNET.CH4.shp)$TMIN
FLUXNET.CH4.shp$TMAX = terra::extract(climate, FLUXNET.CH4.shp)$TMAX
FLUXNET.CH4.shp$MAT = terra::extract(climate, FLUXNET.CH4.shp)$MAT
```
Import elevation information
```{r, include=T}
elevation <- terra::rast("Data/Elevation.tif" )
crs(elevation)
```
Transform to the same CRS:
```{r, include=T}
FLUXNET.CH4.shp = st_transform(FLUXNET.CH4.shp, crs= crs(elevation))
```
Look at the data that is available:
```{r, include=T}
names(elevation)
```
Extract elevation information to sf:
```{r, include=T}
FLUXNET.CH4.shp$ELEVATION = terra::extract(elevation, FLUXNET.CH4.shp)$wc2.1_2.5m_elev
```

# Joining tables
We can combine columns from two (or more) tables together. This can be achieved using the join family of functions in dplyr. There are different types of joins that will result in different outcomes.


inner_join() includes all rows that appear in both the first data frame (x) and the second data frame (y).

left_join() returns all rows from x  based on matching rows on shared columns in y.
right_join() is the companion to left_join(), but returns all rows included in y based on matching rows on shared columns in x.

Import APPEEARS file where I requested MODIS NDVI and EVI data for all FLUXNET_sites:
```{r, include=T}

FLUXNET <- read.csv("Data/ENV720-MOD13A3-061-results.csv")
names(FLUXNET)
```

Subset dataset to include only the columns of interest and rename them:
```{r, include=T}
FLUXNET.sub <- FLUXNET %>% select( "ID", "MOD13A3_061__1_km_monthly_EVI", "MOD13A3_061__1_km_monthly_NDVI", "MOD13A3_061__1_km_monthly_VI_Quality")%>% 
rename( SITE_ID = ID,
EVI = MOD13A3_061__1_km_monthly_EVI,
NDVI = MOD13A3_061__1_km_monthly_NDVI, 
QAQC = MOD13A3_061__1_km_monthly_VI_Quality ) %>% filter( QAQC > 0)

names(FLUXNET.sub)
```
Make the FLUXNET CH4 vector a dataframe:
```{r, include=T}
FLUXNET_CH4 <- as.data.frame( FLUXNET.CH4.shp)
```
Identify the lie column that you should use to join the datasets:
```{r, include=T}
FLUXNET_CH4$SITE_ID
FLUXNET.sub$SITE_ID
```
Use left_join because you want to keep all the data from FLUXNET_CH4 and only the sites in FLUXNET.sub that match the sites in FLUXNET_CH4:
```{r, include=T}
FLUXNET_CH4_final <- FLUXNET_CH4 %>% left_join( FLUXNET.sub, by= 'SITE_ID')
```
Check to make sure the list of sites matches:
```{r, include=T}
length( unique(FLUXNET_CH4$SITE_ID))
length(unique(FLUXNET_CH4_final$SITE_ID))
```
You are now prepared to take data from different sources to build a file to explore patterns in methane infrastructure.
